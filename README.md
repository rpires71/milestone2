# Project Overview

I have chosen to personally develop a **Holiday Destination Finder** website, which forms part of the **Interactive Front-End Development – Milestone Project 2** for the **Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development** (Code Institute, 2025). The website integrates a **Google Maps interface** and provides users with access to booking links for **activities, accommodation, flights, and travel packages**, while also offering an interactive platform for researching travel destinations and viewing **attractions, restaurants, and hotels**.

Across all devices, the website delivers an **intuitive and engaging user experience**, ensuring that it is **fully responsive and accessible**, with a design that adheres to **user-centric development principles** (W3C, 2023). To facilitate straightforward navigation and interaction, the site employs **semantic HTML** and a **meaningful visual hierarchy**, with the user interface structured around a **clear and consistent layout** (Mozilla Developer Network, 2024).

In terms of the project's technical implementation, the main technologies used are **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, incorporating **responsive design techniques** and **modern front-end features** such as **dynamic DOM manipulation**, **CSS transitions**, and **CSS Grid layouts** (Mozilla Developer Network, 2024). The website enables users to interact with map markers and visually explore destinations through **real-time, location-based data**, achieved by integrating the **Google Maps JavaScript API** (Google Developers, 2024).

To connect users with **reputable travel platforms**, additional interactivity is provided through **external booking links**, **animated search feedback**, and **filter buttons**.

In alignment with the expectations of **modern front-end development**, this professional and interactive web application demonstrates my ability to combine **user-focused design** and **real-world functionality** with strong **practical front-end coding skills**.

## Project Goals
[⬆ Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

- Develop a fully functional, responsive web application optimised for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- Adhere to best practices in semantic HTML5 and usability to create an accessible and user-friendly experience.  
- Showcase my professional profile, including teaching and lecturing experience, subject specialisms, and academic qualifications.  
- Provide an interactive environment that encourages students to engage with learning materials and explore available resources.  
- Support communication and professional engagement by incorporating interactive elements such as a contact form and downloadable CV.  
- Highlight technical competencies, including custom styling within a clean, intuitive layout, and the use of HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap.  
- Demonstrate current web development practices with a strong focus on user needs and practical, real-world functionality.


## Purpose of the Website
[⬆ Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

As part of my **User-Centric Frontend Development – Milestone Project 1**, a requirement for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development, I have created this personal portfolio website.

The intended outcome of this project is to build a **responsive**, **accessible**, and **professionally presented** web application that serves a real-world purpose and incorporates user-centric design principles. Specifically, the website is designed as a professional platform showcasing my work as a private tutor and a Computer Science and Mathematics teacher/lecturer.

## Target Audiences
