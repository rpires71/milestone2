## Wireframes
[⬆ Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Before the stage of focusing on design details or styling, a **wireframe** is a stripped-down visual representation of a digital interface, web page, or app that concentrates primarily on the structural layout.

Wireframes are regarded as the **project blueprint**, outlining the placement of key elements, content hierarchy, and navigation flow. Visual representations are typically in grayscale or black and white to maintain focus on usability and user experience (UX) without the distractions of colours, typography, or imagery.

To enable stakeholders to reach consensus on functionality and structure before the stage of refined design and implementation, wireframes represent an essential step in the **pre-production phase** of design and development.

Showcasing wireframes in my milestone 2 project - **Holiday Destination Finder** - is a recognised professional practice which emphasises a systematic, user-focused process. Wireframes serve as the initial conceptual blueprint stage of the project before coding and visual styling begin. During the design and development phase of a project, wireframes are a crucial element which fulfils several significant functions such as:

### Design Rationale and Planning

The following wireframes illustrate strategic usability, content hierarchy, and layout. This evidence helps me break down my project into logical steps so I can plan effectively and make decisions that place user needs and objectives as the priority. The presentation of these wireframes highlights the thought process behind the work rather than the final outcome, which reflects an understanding of the importance of planning through an iterative design approach.


### UX Awareness

The importance of demonstrating an understanding of user experience (UX) principles ensures clarity for the target audeience. Wireframes prioritise flow and functionality before the final visual product, which means I can collaborate effectively with stakeholders at the conceptual stage to refine ideas and minimise time-consuming revisions. This reinforces my commitment to creating a technically robust, intuitive, and user-friendly solution for this project.
