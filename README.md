## Wireframes
[⬆ Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Before the stage of focusing on design details or styling, a **wireframe** is a stripped-down visual representation of a digital interface, web page, or app that concentrates primarily on the structural layout.

Wireframes are regarded as the **project blueprint**, outlining the placement of key elements, content hierarchy, and navigation flow. Visual representations are typically in grayscale or black and white to maintain focus on usability and user experience (UX) without the distractions of colours, typography, or imagery.

To enable stakeholders to reach consensus on functionality and structure before the stage of refined design and implementation, wireframes represent an essential step in the **pre-production phase** of design and development.

Showcasing wireframes in my milestone 2 project - **Holiday Destination Finder** - is a recognised professional practice which emphasises a systematic, user-focused process. Wireframes serve as the initial conceptual blueprint stage of the project before coding and visual styling begin. During the design and development phase of a project, wireframes are a crucial element which fulfils several significant functions such as:

### Design Rationale and Planning

The following wireframes illustrate strategic usability, content hierarchy, and layout. This evidence helps me break down my project into logical steps so I can plan effectively and make decisions that place user needs and objectives as the priority. The presentation of these wireframes highlights the thought process behind the work rather than the final outcome, which reflects an understanding of the importance of planning through an iterative design approach.


### UX Awareness

The importance of demonstrating an understanding of user experience (UX) principles ensures clarity for the target audeience. Wireframes prioritise flow and functionality before the final visual product, which means I can collaborate effectively with stakeholders at the conceptual stage to refine ideas and minimise time-consuming revisions. This reinforces my commitment to creating a technically robust, intuitive, and user-friendly solution for this project.

### Overview and Rationale

To reflect both the emotional experience of planning a trip and contemporary digital design, relaxation, exploration, and travel are the sensations evoked through the colour palette for the Holiday Destination Finder website (Agrawal, 2025; Baradell, 2023; DesigningIt, 2024). With interactive features such as “Search” or “Book,” user engagement is encouraged, while the coral accent adds energy (Agrawal, 2025), and blues and neutrals convey openness, clarity, and trust (Baradell, 2023; DesigningIt, 2024).

### Justification

**Travel-Inspired Blue Palette for Trust and Calmness**

For a travel planning platform, essential qualities such as reliability, calmness, and trust are associated with the universally recognised colour blue (Baradell, 2023; DesigningIt, 2024). A sense of adventure when browsing destinations and feelings of clarity help users experience these emotions – the sky and the sea – reflected through the colour combination of Ocean Blue (#0077B6) and Sky Blue (#90E0EF).

**Warm Accents to Encourage Interaction**

For calls to action such as “Search Hotels” or “Book Activities,” attention is drawn through the use of Coral Orange (#FF6B35), which serves as a contrasting accent (Agrawal, 2025; DesigningIt, 2024). Without overwhelming the design, this energetic yet balanced hue stimulates curiosity and introduces vitality and warmth to the interface (Agrawal, 2025).

**Neutral Foundation for Readability and Accessibility**

Buttons, maps, and images are allowed to stand out clearly through the use of a calm, minimalist background featuring Sand Beige (#FAF3E0) and White Smoke (#F5F5F5) (DesigningIt, 2024). While maintaining a clean and professional aesthetic, this colour contrast ensures visual comfort across all devices (Baradell, 2023; DesigningIt, 2024).

**Professionalism and Clarity through Charcoal Grey Typography**

For all users, including those with visual impairments, legibility is enhanced through supported long-form reading that uses accessible text colours such as Charcoal Grey (#2F3E46), providing strong contrast (W3C, 2023). Warmer coral accents and cooler blues complement one another, conveying a sense of professionalism (Agrawal, 2025; Baradell, 2023).

**Consistent Branding and Hierarchical Balance**

A unified visual hierarchy is maintained through interactive components, forms, icons, and navigation, ensured by the defined six-colour scheme (DesigningIt, 2024). Accessibility and visual stability are achieved through the use of darker and neutral tones, while brand identity is reinforced within interactive elements and navigation by the strategic use of Ocean Blue and Coral Orange (Agrawal, 2025; Baradell, 2023). 

### Applied Colour Theory Principles

**1. Analogous Harmony**

Sky-themed or coastal aesthetics, which are characteristic of travel design, are reflected and naturally harmonised through the palette combination of neutral beige and analogous shades of blue (Baradell, 2023; DesigningIt, 2024).

**2. Complementary Contrasty**

Guiding user attention effectively towards interactive elements and enhancing visual appeal, the dominant blues are complemented by the contrasting Coral Orange (Baradell, 2023; Agrawal, 2025). 

**3. Psychological Impact**

Coral Orange conveys excitement, optimism, and a sense of adventure, while blue supports trust, professionalism, and calm within key interface areas (Agrawal, 2025; Baradell, 2023). Neutral tones such as Beige and White Smoke help maintain balance and visual clarity in line with modern web colour trends (DesigningIt, 2024).

**4. Accessibility and Readability**

For headings and body text, WCAG contrast guidelines are satisfied with this colour palette. Lighting conditions and screen resolution ensure that key information remains legible, with light backgrounds supporting dark typography, and vice versa (W3C, 2023; DesigningIt, 2024).

**5. Visual Consistency and Brand Recognition**

To maintain brand cohesion across cards, filters, forms, and navigation bars, all page elements follow the same defined colour palette. The site’s responsive design framework (Bootstrap 5 combined with custom CSS) ensures a consistent tone that creates a professional and memorable user experience (Bootstrap, 2024; DesigningIt, 2024).

### Strategic Use of Colour

- **Emphasis**: Calls to action such as “Book” or “Explore” and interactive elements utilise Coral Orange (#FF6B35) (Agrawal, 2025; DesigningIt, 2024).
- **Hierarchy**: For body text, Charcoal Grey (#2F3E46) is applied; for navigation and main headings, Ocean Blue (#0077B6) is used (99designs, 2024; DesigningIt, 2024). 
- **Consistency**: To strengthen visual identity, the established colour palette is consistently applied across all cards, menus, and icons (DesigningIt, 2024; Interaction Design Foundation, 2023).
- **Balance**: Maintaining a sense of openness, fluidity, and lightness across sections is achieved through the use of Sky Blue (#90E0EF) (99designs, 2024; DesigningIt, 2024).
- **Contrast**: Provided a strong contrast against darker typography by using the colours Sand Beige (#FAF3E0) and White Smoke (#F5F5F5) (W3C, 2023; DesigningIt, 2024).


### Summary

To appear engaging, trustworthy, and professional, an interface has been created that combines travel-oriented emotional design with modern usability principles through the selected colour palette (Interaction Design Foundation, 2023; DesigningIt, 2024). 

Aligned with its brand purpose, a sense of adventure, accessibility, and visual harmony is achieved in the Holiday Destination Finder website by combining calm, balanced neutral tones and oceanic blues with energising coral accents (Agrawal, 2025; 99designs, 2024). 

By planning and booking their next journey with confidence, users are encouraged to explore, and a fully responsive, aesthetically balanced, and inclusive experience is ensured through the site’s considered use of colour (Interaction Design Foundation, 2023; DesigningIt, 2024).
