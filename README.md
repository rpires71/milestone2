## Project Overview
[⬆ Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

I have chosen to personally develop a **Holiday Destination Finder** website, which forms part of the **Interactive Front-End Development – Milestone Project 2** for the **Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development** (Code Institute, 2025). The website integrates a **Google Maps interface** and provides users with access to booking links for **activities, accommodation, flights, and travel packages**, while also offering an interactive platform for researching travel destinations and viewing **attractions, restaurants, and hotels**.

Across all devices, the website delivers an **intuitive and engaging user experience**, ensuring that it is **fully responsive and accessible**, with a design that adheres to **user-centric development principles** (W3C, 2023). To facilitate straightforward navigation and interaction, the site employs **semantic HTML** and a **meaningful visual hierarchy**, with the user interface structured around a **clear and consistent layout** (Mozilla Developer Network, 2024).

In terms of the project's technical implementation, the main technologies used are **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, incorporating **responsive design techniques** and **modern front-end features** such as **dynamic DOM manipulation**, **CSS transitions**, and **CSS Grid layouts** (Mozilla Developer Network, 2024). The website enables users to interact with map markers and visually explore destinations through **real-time, location-based data**, achieved by integrating the **Google Maps JavaScript API** (Google Developers, 2024).

To connect users with **reputable travel platforms**, additional interactivity is provided through **external booking links**, **animated search feedback**, and **filter buttons**.

In alignment with the expectations of **modern front-end development**, this professional and interactive web application demonstrates my ability to combine **user-focused design** and **real-world functionality** with strong **practical front-end coding skills**.

## Project Goals
[⬆ Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The primary objective of the **Holiday Destination Finder** project is to allow users to explore, research, and plan holiday destinations through the design and development of a **user-centred interactive front-end web application** that is both dynamic and fully operational.

By incorporating **API-based interactivity**, **responsive interface design**, and **accessible navigation structures**, the project aims to satisfy all requirements outlined within the **Code Institute Interactive Front-End Development – Milestone Project 2** specification (Code Institute, 2025).

1. **Dynamic Front-End Functionality**
   
   Without dependence on external frameworks, all interactivity and DOM manipulation are achieved through the development of a fully interactive website utilising **custom HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.
   
   Real-time, location-specific data such as hotels, restaurants, attractions, cafés, and other points of interest are dynamically rendered through the integration of the **Google Maps JavaScript API**, **Google Places API (New)**, and **Google Geocoding API** (Google Developers, 2024).

2. **Responsive User Experience**
   
   To deliver a seamless and consistent user experience by ensuring that the interface is **fully responsive across contemporary devices and varying screen resolutions**.
   
   To adhere to the **Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)** guidelines when applying **user-focused design principles** to enhance accessibility, navigation, and usability (W3C, 2023).

3. **User Interaction and Feedback**
   
   To provide adaptive responses to user interactions, including destination searches, booking button actions, and filtering functionality through the implementation of **JavaScript-driven interactivity**.
   
   To enhance usability and engagement by incorporating **visual indicators and animations** during searches, filter operations, and map interactions (Mozilla Developer Network, 2024).

4. **Information Architecture and Navigation**
   
   To establish a coherent structure by implementing a consistent section hierarchy and a clear primary navigation menu through the design of a **well-organised and logical layout**.
   
   To support accessibility, search engine optimisation (SEO), and maintainable front-end development standards through the application of **semantic HTML** (Mozilla Developer Network, 2024).

5. **Integration with External Services**
   
   Collaborating with trusted third-party platforms such as **Booking.com**, **Expedia**, and **GetYourGuide** to incorporate **external booking integrations** for flights, accommodation, leisure activities, and comprehensive travel packages.
   
   To ensure that these integrations enhance the overall user experience without compromising accessibility, functionality, or usability.

6. **Version Control and Deployment**
   
   Throughout the project lifecycle, **Git and GitHub** are utilised to facilitate continuous version control, monitor development progress, and uphold transparency within the development process.
   
   To comply with contemporary web deployment standards and guarantee public accessibility, the final iteration of the project is deployed to **GitHub Pages** (Code Institute, 2025).

7. **Documentation and Attribution**
   
   To compile detailed project documentation outlining the purpose, functionality, and technical scope within a comprehensive `README.md` file.
   
   To credit all external resources, libraries, or tutorials in line with **Code Institute’s attribution and academic integrity policy** (Code Institute, 2025).

### Outcome

By accomplishing these objectives, the project demonstrates advanced proficiency in front-end web development, effective utilisation of **JavaScript for dynamic interactivity**, and an in-depth understanding of **practical, user-oriented web design**.

While reflecting the standards expected at Level 5 in **Web Application Development**, the final product showcases both **technical competence** and **professional presentation**,  (Code Institute, 2025).

## Purpose of the Website
[⬆ Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

As part of my **User-Centric Frontend Development – Milestone Project 1**, a requirement for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development, I have created this personal portfolio website.

The intended outcome of this project is to build a **responsive**, **accessible**, and **professionally presented** web application that serves a real-world purpose and incorporates user-centric design principles. Specifically, the website is designed as a professional platform showcasing my work as a private tutor and a Computer Science and Mathematics teacher/lecturer.

## Target Audiences
[⬆ Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

This website serves multiple related audiences:

- **Students:**  
  Explore resources, view examples of my work, and understand how I deliver learning experiences in Computer Science and Mathematics.

- **Education Providers and Employers:**  
  Learn about my teaching experience, qualifications, subject specialisms, and download a copy of my CV.

- **Parents and Guardians:**  
  Read student feedback, get in touch via the contact form, and evaluate my approach to teaching and tutoring.

## Key Features and Skills Demonstrated
[⬆ Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The website highlights my experience as an educator while also showcasing my technical skills in front-end web development, including:

- Responsive design using CSS media queries and/or Bootstrap  
- Semantic, accessible HTML5 structure  
- Custom CSS styling  
- Clean, professional layout and intuitive navigation  
- Interactive elements such as a contact form and downloadable resources  

This project reflects my ability to apply modern web development techniques in a user-focused context, while presenting my professional identity as an educator.
